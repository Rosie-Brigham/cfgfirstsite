<h1><strong>WELL. APPARENTLY IT MAY BE YOUR BIRTHDAY!</strong></h1>
<b1>and so I have produced this wonderful website (well, github thing. I really dont understand it) to explain to you how awesom it is that it is your birthday</b1>
<p><body>It is a very special day, a day that only comes once a year, and on this special day I have prepared some things for you. unfortunately my coding skills dont quite parraleell what I <em>can actually</em> produce, so if you take this page, then take a load of halluceinagens, add a bit more glitter and holograms, and you should be just about there.</body> <p> 

	also eve, if you are reading over Matts shoulder, I am very sorry for all these spelling mistakes, but its fine, Matt wont notice and he's the only one who really counts today (sozzles bbz)


	
so I guess I should really list some things... but first a cheeky birthday treat.</p>

<body>well I guess its not nessecarily a treat, but its a fantastic picture. If your ever struggling in life, or even tday at work, just remember: at least you are not a T-rex trying to reach a lamp.
